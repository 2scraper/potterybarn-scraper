"""One secret scanner, four scopes — and it is meant to run BEFORE a commit.

This exists because of a real incident. On 2026-09-22 a `.env.user-endpoint.bak`
holding three live credentials was committed and pushed to a public repository.
Two separate guards failed to stop it:

* `.gitignore` listed `.env` as an exact name, and the backup had a suffix;
* the repo's secret check walked a LIST OF EXTENSIONS — `.py/.md/.txt/.yml/
  .toml` — and `.bak` was not on it, so it printed "39 files scanned, nothing
  credential-shaped" in the very commit that carried the keys.

Both were after-the-fact checks in CI. By the time CI could have complained,
the objects were already on a public server — and deleting the branch does NOT
remove them: a ref is a pointer, and GitHub serves unreachable objects by SHA.
So the only guard that actually protects anything is one that runs on YOUR
machine, before the commit object exists.

    python3 tools/scan_secrets.py --staged     # what is about to be committed
    python3 tools/scan_secrets.py --worktree   # every tracked file
    python3 tools/scan_secrets.py --range A..B # commits about to be pushed
    python3 tools/scan_secrets.py --history    # every blob that ever existed

Exit 0 clean, 1 if anything matched. `--history` is the one to run before
making a repository public.
